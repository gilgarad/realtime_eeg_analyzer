# Initially Cloned
Initially cloned from Nadzeri's project to test Emotiv headset and its emotions analysis.

github:
https://github.com/nadzeri/Realtime-EEG-Based-Emotion-Recognition

1. webapp will be reused and added some features later

2. reading emotiv packets REPLACED with official api implemented version

3. analysis of emotions with conventional algorithms WILL BE CHANGED to machine learning algorithms

Therefore, at the end none of the codes except webapp will be left from the cloned project.

This if for the matter of convenience; clone and fix is faster than create and set up from scratch.
