# Initially Cloned
Initially cloned from Nadzeri's project to test Emotiv headset and its emotions analysis.

github:
https://github.com/nadzeri/Realtime-EEG-Based-Emotion-Recognition

Mostly newly implemented(90 percent or above) and only conventional arousal/valence train-predict model is used from original

~~1. webapp will be reused and added some features later~~

~~2. reading emotiv packets REPLACED with official api implemented version~~

~~3. analysis of emotions with conventional algorithms WILL BE CHANGED to machine learning algorithms~~

~~Therefore, at the end none of the codes except webapp will be left from the cloned project.~~

~~This if for the matter of convenience; clone and fix is faster than create and set up from scratch.~~




# Pre-requisites
1. Emotiv Epoc+ 14 channels
2. Emotiv Pro with license (implementation is retrieving raw data from emotiv pro's cortex api)
3. pip install -r requirement.txt

# Start
python realtime_emotion.py
